Rationale
=========

Dynamic Pilgrim was created to take table tennis at CFA to the next level. We wanted a way to keep track of rankings and head to head matches, while learning Ruby on Rails.

Process
=======

Before developing Dynamic Pilgrim, we thought through questions such as:

* How can we entice people to join the rankings?
* How can we make sure the point system works for all skill levels?
* Should we favour the lower ranked player?
* How can we incorporate payment systems that we've been learning?
* How do we handle the match result updating to make it sustainable?

Solution
========

A ranking website for CFA table tennis. Tiered subscription plan that gives access to extra features based on the subscription plan.
